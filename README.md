# Coding-Quiz

In this task I was to create a quiz using html, CSS, and JavaScript. The most difficult part for me was the writing the JavaScript and trying to get everything to work properly. I had trouble getting the timer and score function to work how I wanted it too. The most time-consuming part for me was getting the questions to work along with the next button.

If I were to do this task over, I would have started on it earlier to give myself time to research better on how to get the timer and score functions to work. Would also take more time styling the page so it does not look so bland. I used a couple YouTube videos and websites to help me out with the questions but overall this assignment was not easy for me but I would like to better my knowledge in JavaScript, so next assignment I will get do better.
